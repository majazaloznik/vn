1. Start journal.

2. prepare empty Skeleton folder structure: `vn`
(see Appendix 1. for background info on how it was designed)

3. Add appendix 1 as child .Rmd file, this is already a first dependency to add to the make file!! ToDo

4. But first a new project and git repo.

5. Write pretty comrehensive .gitignore file -- only code and journals are tracked. 

6. Initial commit. 

7. first dependency, try to write it up in my brand new makefile! 

* OK this didn't go super smoothly. Getting `make: nothing to be done` error
* Aha, the reason for that was i had spaces instead of tabs in the makefile. works now. 

8. Am I doing both to pdf and html and docx? does this work if the files don't exist yet? OK, make sure `all` is updated whenever you add new targets, duh!

9. Makefile gets split into 

* variable definitions
+ folders
+ file lists
+ commands
* recipes

10. OK, let's try visualising this now with makefile2grapy. 

## Thursday 23.11.2017 

1. So makefile2graph didn't work. just produced an empty graph, not sure why, might try on linux, but no worry.

2. Tried the `makefile2dot.py` fiel I got from [here](https://github.com/vak/makefile2dot). This works on my windows machine, which has Python after:

* I added `C:\\Python27` to the `PATH`
* put the `makefile2dot.py` in the top folder
* opened cmd.exe as admin
* ran `python makefile2dot.py <Makefile >out.dot` from the same folder. Note the `.py` added, as it didn't work before.

This produces a `.dot` file. 

BUT. 

* It doesn't expand the variables. So basically this means leaving all the file names explicit instead of using variables for lists of 
* I just used agread and plot in Rgraphviz, which works, nbut not sure how to add the arrows. 
* Also the .dot file has all the `$(FOLDER)/` strings in front of file names, which makes it perhaps a bit unwieldy. Need to see how to stript hem off

3. OK, so I'll try installing Graphviz on the machine, so I can use `dot` as the command directly. Alhtough it would be cool to have the R version as well. Hmm, need to make this work on both linux and ubuntu..

4. this is all i've got with package `Rgraphviz`
make <- agread(file = "out.dot")
make2 <- agopen(make)
make@edgemode <- "directed"

plot(make)
edgeData(make)

. Next task is figuring out whether i want render or knitr or ezknitr? And how to get rid of those annoyign folders that knitting to pdf seems to leave behind. Hmm, seems like this is a weird pandoc/Windows artefact.. With a lot of help from this nice writeup: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/40563480/801398]

## Friday 24.11.2017

1. New attempt at visualisation based on this [https://heidiseibold.github.io/r/2015/09/16/Visualizing-Makefiles/]. But doesn't look too reliable long term, so I give up.

2. Back to the previous solution and try to get the dot file to work , this time using `DiagrammeR` [http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html]. OK, DiagrammeR looks swish af, but the problem is the .dot file I've got is not smooth enough. Like e.g. it would need to have special node statements and edge statements. That way node names are defined as labels, because otherwise node names cannot have special characters in them (., $, -, etc). 

3. Actually no, it's OK, DiagrammeR works directly using `grViz("out.dot")`!!

4. So let's add this to the make file then!!

5. OK, so the problem now becomes that the output of grViz is not sth that can be easily saved to a image file. aparently anyway. See it isn't renderred as a plot, it's renderred in the Viewer pane in  Rstudio. So the standard save plot things don't work here.

6. Now I want to run this visualisation of the makefile diagram externally, not inside the jounral:

* so that it is modular, and I can use the diagram elsewhere
* so that the journal can be renderred in .html, .pdf, .doc -- as it seems the grViz ouput only plays nice with .html. Aha, the output is actually an `htmlwidget`, that is helpful to know. Here are instructions for saving [leaflet ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31336898/how-to-save-leaflet-in-r-map-as-png-or-jpg-file), but that's for maps. 

7. OK, getting closer. Now the V8 package, which used to work for export to SVG is no longer maintained or some such thing, so instead there is DiagrammeRsvg. Now I need to figure out what to do with the svg. 

8. Right, svg is an odd thing. Looks like this might help `convertGraph`. For it to work you need phantom.js from here: http://phantomjs.org/download.html. Hmm, this will be a problem for switching between platforms

9. SO far Ive got this 

```
require(DiagrammeR)
require(DiagrammeRsvg)
require(convertGraph)
svg <- export_svg(grViz("make.dot"))
install.phantom("C:/Program Files/phantomjs-2.1.1-windows/bin")
convertGraph("make.svg", "example.png", path = "C:/Program Files/phantomjs-2.1.1-windows/bin")

```
and gives me 

```
Warning message:
running command ''C:/Program Files/phantomjs-2.1.1-windows/bin' C:/R_Libs/convertGraph/lib/command.js make.svg example.png' had status 127
```

## Sunday 26.11.2017

1. OK, how about another way of converting svg, `rsvg` looks like it could be a [thing ](https://www.opencpu.org/posts/svg-release/), I'll try that instead. Yes, and it works!

2. Now have to add this to the makefile, and to do that, I need to understand how to reference the target and dependenices properly. Also, how long are scripts in Rscript before I write them to file? How many require packages e.g. would I still cram into a `Rscript` line?

3. Here it is: 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("/figures/make.png"))
```

`![](figures/make.png)`

4. OK, this works, but I do now have the problem of relative paths between this .Rmd file and fiures.. so need to fix that with a chunk option or ezknitr. OK, so one thing I'm not too clear on is the fact that `knitr::knit` only renders to html apparently, and not to pdf, that is done by `rmarkdown::render`. But people think the pdf and doc compiles are knitting because the rstudio button is the same. But so looks like ezknitr won't work with pdf, also doens't parse YAML headers, at least according to the [open issues](https://github.com/ropensci/ezknitr/issues/). 

5. Apparenlty `here` is a simple way of sloving all my problems according to [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here#readme  ). ALthough there seems [based on Yihui's attitude](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1411) to be very little chance of a satisfacotry solution. But I think it works as `knitr::include_graphcs(here::here())`. So this is sorted then. 

6. Cool, relative paths in chunks from the project folder can be done using `here::here()` although i'm not clear on what Yihui's problem is, but it seems to be a robust solution. 

7. OK, now I need to move the journals folder from the top level, that was silly anyway, and now i can also test how portable the setup is atm. 

8. Also, note that the make file and being able to visualise it means i don't need a super-structured directory structure..

9. Let's see if I can't move the makefile2dot.py out of the project folder as well. Cool that works. 

10. Clean up the dir structure a bit. ALso figure out how to refer to target (`$@`) and to target dir (`$(@D)`). Neat.

11. How to add the tree structure of the folder to e.g. this file. One option is thrhough the makefile. Another is through some sort of R-system command?

12. OK, this is not working, system throws me a 127 error, shell kind of works, but not with ASCi characters, and even if I get it to work, this is Windows, atm, so god knows what will happen on linux. I'll try direct from the makefile creating a .txt file, and reading it in. ?! OK, no idea how to do that. I mean it works using tree, but as soon as i add the -a option it stops. 


*. For the record: my argument for keeping a non-streamlined makefile is based on [this article on why you should never rewrite code that works](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) 


## Monday 27.11.2017

1. clear out those pesky pdf folders that show up when Rmd files get compiled to pdf sometimes.  

2. `rm -rf` -f option is force (no error) and -r is recursive. Although I don't know how to search for the folders recursively, but they should all be two down from docs, so `./docs/*/tex2pdf*` should list them all.  

3. ad 12. from yesterday, i'll just do it manually i guess.

4. OK, so template folder has also been set up and saved. Only issue there is that it only works if `here::here()` can figure out the project folder. Aah, but usitn `rprojroot` instead and specifying that the `makefile` needs to be in the root folder, that works. 

5. Before I call this finished, let me just move the make.dot file into processed data. 

6. OK, so clean template copy has been made. Now focus on VN. 

7. Appendix 2 is the directory tree from which I am migrating. 

8. OK, so now migration starts, how do I keep track of it though?!

9. First the mapping stuff. SO, looking at the `VietnamABM\Scripts\S01-maps.R` situation it looks like I had downloaded some shape file from an unknown locaiton, and then saved as .RData. But this needs to be tracable, so doing it again and proper. 

10. Now need to figure out how to deal with this. GADM seems to be a good source, even has a package `GADMTOols`, but I run into some library folder issues. Maybe I just download the file, but is that done in the makefile? or what. 

## Tuesday 28.11.2017

1. Hmm, does the `makefile2dot.py` know how to tell unpack e.g. `%` variables? No, it doens't work, I'll have to write them all out explicitly. I'll call that  feature not a bug :)

2. Ad 10 yesterday, OK so while `GADMTOols` looks great, there seems to be some sort of library issue, also I'm getting a projection issue, so I'll instead dowload the .rds file. 

3. So first need to set up the makefile to dowload the file if it doesn't exist. Jesus, this is a mess, I don't actually know how to do this on widnows (`curl` and `wget` aren't working) so maybe I should just download through R - if the file doesn't exist. 

4. OK, so Rscript to download it is good. 

5. Now i need a script to clean it and save the resulting rds for plotting. 

6. First problem is that the 63 provinces in the GADM map are not grouped by region. 

7. I finda  table of provinces and regions on Wikipedia. But there is an encoding problem.. Vietnamese characters.. But I need them Vietnamese in order to match the table with the datatable in the spatialpolygonsdataframe. 

8. Then I also need to fix the hyphen/dash situation to make the match. jesus. Then still have to manually match a few regions -- ToDo figure out how to do approximate matching in R..

9. OK, so now province and region table is added to the spatialpolygon dataframe. And need to fix the makefile.

## Wednesday 29.11.2017

1. So, ad 9. yesterday, we have a map data clean file now. The output of which is a processed rds file? And then there should be another map function file, which will deal with plots?

2. OK, so makefile now downloads, and processes map data. 

3. Now need to plot sth ;)

4. Little detour trying to figure out roxygen, neat, but not really useful for this project, alhtough the funciton commenting protocol is. 

5. Wow, OK, this is working now: the data is downloaded, cleaned up, then plotted using a sounrce function script ;). What if I remove the downloaded data? Nice, works ;)

6. Ok, but i should really do stuff like merging provinces, or selecting regions in the data-cleaing code, no? So then the output there is e.g. 4 different `.rds` files. Which I will use a variable list name for inthe makefile, since it will be too unwieldly otherwise. 

7. changed my mind about 6 actually.. selecting subsets will happen if/when needed. So back to only one rds being processed. 

8. OK, so the first plot - of norhtern vn and the provinces .. looks great, but has way too much detail, which is killing the eps. I must have reduced the detail at some point in the previous one, but it isn't documented. I'll do it now..

9. Also, makefile/scripting means I can't use dev2eps.copy, but postscript() instead, this might need some additional figuring out.

10. OK, simplifying the Vietnam map, using `rgeos::gSimplify` - careful, this removes the dataframe, you need to keep it and add it back. ARGH, but unions have to happen before simplifying... 

11. OMG, OK, found the simplifying tool: `mapshaper::ms_simplify` is what i want! [from here](https://philmikejones.me/post/2016-09-29-simplify-polygons-without-creating-slivers/). So this is great, unfortunately it does sth weird with the data.frame attached to the sp object, in particular has issues with the econding.. 

12. So decided to first remove the df table from the spdf, then simplify, then add it back. ARGH. 

## Thursday 30.11.2017 

1. But now there is anohter problem the eps form the makefile isn't the same as the one I run direct from R. This must have sth to do with the Vietnamese characters, I'm selecting the subset of 4 provinces by name, and they are presumably empty when run via Rscript.

2. OK, I can't be bothered figuring this out, I will instead just refer to the provinces by code/ID. Got it.

3. OK, now there is the issue of labels. Right now this had a psfrag labelling system, alhtough I can see up ahead that it doesnt' work. SO I'll do a system where they are called `-labs.eps` and `-psf.eps`, so produce two figure files. And they can be referred to as a variable in the makefile, to reduce clutter. 

4. OK, there was a bit of trouble here, but got them to work - the location of where you declare the variable as a file list apparently matters..

5. Now still have the issue of the fact that maps gets run every time, regardless of any changes, and the 50 or so errors that get produced, I guess because of the bloody VN letters in the labels.. 

6. Hmm, ok, sth to do with eps!? I need to do a minimal example to figure out wtf..

7. And not sure about the labels, what is causing it. OK, yeah, it's the NAME_1 labels, changed them to VARNAME_1.

8. There's another issue though, e.g. now the 01-maps.R script has code for two plots, and so there are two targets in the $(map-north01) variable, so that means it gets run twice. But that's not what I want is it. I want it to run once. OK, wow, solved with th **pattern rule** from this amazing [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3077254/801398).  

9. This looks like a good setup for multiple output formats. Although the whole knitr/rmarkdown/render dsitinciton.. I need to work on that a bit. 

## Friday 1.12.2017

1. ad 6. - minimal example for eps. OK, I've got a minimal example that is possibly too minimal - as in it works normally as expected.

2. OK, looks like it has to do with the FiGs folder, if I move the eps file to the project folder there is no repeat.. try minimal again. OMFG, OK, I think I've figured it out. kind of anywya, Sth to do with the FIGs folder and variable.. I had misspelled FIG and FIGS, so that was one thing, then also used the forward slash in the variable name for the map.eps list of files, and it didn't like that.. Christ, and that's not even all of it. there is also an issue with the Rplots.pdf, and that only happens iwth the lab file, not the psfrag one. 

* OK, no the slash was not a problem, I'll keep using it. 
* There is still the Rplots.pdf that I'm not sure what in the plotting opes it, but might have sth to do with this probelm [described here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6543027/801398)
* So now it looks like it had sth to do with the % i was using in the list definition. 
* Which is very annoying because just a few days ago I had to add them in order to stop the code from running twice for two targets.. Turns out that isn't true?

3. Question - how can you pass an argument through Rscript - e.g. a folder to save outputs in? Yes, you just assign the variable before the source. e.g. if the script file says `print(1+x)` then this will produce 12:

```
test: script.R
	Rscript -e "x <- 11; source('$<')"
```

4. So to make the whole system even more mobile, I can as **a rule** assign folders in the makefile, not in the R scripts themselves. So let's fix the `01-maps.R` file, and have it not decide what folders to put the files in. 

5. Lol, that almost didn't work because i had a rm() statement at the beginning of the file, yikes!

6. AND this works with `'$(@D)'` as well, AMAZEBALLS!

# Tuesday 10.4.2018 

1. OK, so I think i've managed to figure out what I've done so far, and pick it up from there

2. In the mean time I had had a bit more of a look at makefile, and basically not figured out much, except that I still don't know how to do multiple targets, so instead I just use the first one. 

3. So the map part is done, that covers `S01-maps`. 

4. But perhaps I don't want to be doing the whole .eps-tex-dvi-ps-pdf thing if I can instead do Rmd?

5. In which case I also want to be a bit modular at least - with child inputs, not everything in one file. 
I guess the question is then if the children work as stand alones?

6. Very cool, it seems to actually work: the parent file ignores the YAML (at least the title and author, it's not repeating it, which is great). 

7. Unfortunately the Rnws i'd made won't work. Which isn't a massive problem except when it comes to tables..

8. What about bibliographies, how did that work? Should be OK

9. Manually recoding 02Outline.Rnw to 01_AMB-report_02_Outline.Rmd. 

10. Plot `C:\Users\sfos0247\Dropbox\analysis\Vietnam\VietnamABM\Scripts\old\SoftwareDiagram.R`, but needs nice
fonts. 

11. Only issue is now references don't work from the child document. But let me first update the makefile. 

12. OK, so moved over the makefile recipes i'd used before. And it seems I need to use touch when just listing dependencies for the dot files sake. So weird, I'll never get a hang of this make stuff..

13. OK, bibliography. Oh, it's fine, it was tabbed in the yaml when it didn't need to be. 

14. How about references and cross references? Apparently bookdown [https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/a-single-document.html](here) is the explanation of how it might be relevant for a single document as well. SO not doing an actual book, but there are `bookdown::pdf_document2` versions that should allow references. Lemme try. 

15. OK, figure labels work `\@ref(fig:label) ` using the chunk name. 

16. Let me see how it works with word. Yess, actually looks great!

17. OK, but I can't figure out tables or rather kables!? wtf? Right, they work -  i just had the format = latex option on, which obviously didn't work with word, but if i remove it it works with either automatically. 

18. Now need to figure out the image? Doesnt' work for word, or pdf!? 

# Wednesday 11.4.2018

1. First make sure I can render to pdf and word: using the bookdown versions of both works: I can knit from Rstudio witht he yaml:

``` r
output:
  bookdown::pdf_document2: null
  bookdown::word_document2: null
```

2. Now I only need to get that into the makefile. Excellent, simply add `output = all` in the render call.Actually no, that didn't work. Raise SO issue! 

3. Also the rmarkdown::render() output doenst' call the bookdown funcitons -- obviously, i need to call the `bookdown::pdf_document2()` functions presumably? OK, no, looks like the `:null` was the problem - even thouth it appeared automatically! it should be default, like this:

``` r
output:
  bookdown::pdf_document2: default
  bookdown::word_document2: default
```

4. OK, so this seems to be working now, both doc and pdf files work i.e. have references.

5. Now fix the fact that the pdf file seems to be ignoring the fig.height and width options. OK, this was fixed using `out.width = "400px"`

6. But this is not supported in Word - i mean it's not causing a problem atm, just a warning, but how should one deal with this? With some chunk options working in pdf but not in word? Same thing for kableExtra, says I should specify output format!?

7. OK, this is too much, i'll just do a screenshot of the table and deal with it some other time. 

8. Now the problem is that the caption doesnt' work for the table. At least not in Word.

9. Unless I add it manually?

10. Moving on, turns out Word doesn't automatically number sections, so I have to set up a reference document..

11. Haha, I just found out how to set up multilevel section numbering in Word..[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/timid/2013/08/29/stupid-microsoft-word-trick-multilevel-numbered-headings/](hilarious if it weren't sad). 

12. OK, so numbering and referencing is OK in pdf, but in Word there is the issue that the TOC gets it's own heading title, which then fucks up. So you need to change the style of the TOC heading in the word document to one based on Body - i.e. not Heading. 

13. OK, now starting on `03_Analysis.Rmd`.

14. OMG, what just happened just now!? everything was working OK knitting from Rstudio and then failed on make. and then bit by bit went back to find that it was probably an issue with `coordinates` which was being masked between `sp` and `diagram` . But i don't know why make would be an issue. But adding `sp::` and `diagram::` has now fixed it (after an hour or so). 

15. OK, next thing is the IPUMS age box plots. That was all done originaly in `Scripts/IPUMS/01IPUMSimport.R` but obviously needs to be an import and a plotting script. 


# Thursday 12.4.2018

1. Split `Scripts/IPUMS/01IPUMSimport.R` into an import script and a plotting script. 

2. The data import is now `C:\Users\sfos0247\Dropbox\analysis\vn\code\data-cleaning\01_IPUMS_import.R`, the output of which is an `.RData` file that I'll keep in processed data.

3. In the import file noticed that some people have missing ages coded as 999, which hadn't been removed earlier, but have been now. 

4. OOps, yesterday I got the map to work in 03_analysis, but never updated the makefile. So in order to plot the map in the chunk i need the `VNM_adm1.rds` data and source the `fun-maps.R` functions. If they get updated, touch 03_Analysis. 

5. OK, so the IPUMS now. Oh, actually `Scripts/IPUMS/01IPUMSimport.R` was not the clean version, `S05-IPUMS-import` is the clean version!!

6. So, clean up the import and clean even more, so that the heads.Rdata file is tiny. OK.

7. Now I'll turn the boxplot funcitons into a function only script, and then call both from the analysis rmd in a chunk. 

8. Mah, it's OK, the legend isn't perfectly legible in the Word file, but whatever. 

9. OK, make whole report - something odd with the `00_gamd-maps` file? but running it manually was ok. Won't look at it now, but the error was object length mismatch for the spatialpolygonsdataframe call saying it had 65 polygon objects, but df had 66 rows. Maybe that's because of the simplification? it looses a whole row?

10. OK, next we have retirement table. This was clearly based on additional data cleaning, so I add that part to the IPUMS import file. Also here remove people aged 999. And save them in a different processed data file: 

11. OK, so so close with the table, there is even a fucntion called `kable_to_image()` for word, but gives me an error about not having ghostscript installed, which isn't true. so back to screenshots of tables for now..

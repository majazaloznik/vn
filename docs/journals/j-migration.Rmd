1. Start journal.

2. prepare empty Skeleton folder structure: `vn`
(see Appendix 1. for background info on how it was designed)

3. Add appendix 1 as child .Rmd file, this is already a first dependency to add to the make file!! ToDo

4. But first a new project and git repo.

5. Write pretty comrehensive .gitignore file -- only code and journals are tracked. 

6. Initial commit. 

7. first dependency, try to write it up in my brand new makefile! 

* OK this didn't go super smoothly. Getting `make: nothing to be done` error
* Aha, the reason for that was i had spaces instead of tabs in the makefile. works now. 

8. Am I doing both to pdf and html and docx? does this work if the files don't exist yet? OK, make sure `all` is updated whenever you add new targets, duh!

9. Makefile gets split into 

* variable definitions
+ folders
+ file lists
+ commands
* recipes

10. OK, let's try visualising this now with makefile2grapy. 

## Thursday 23.11.2017 

1. So makefile2graph didn't work. just produced an empty graph, not sure why, might try on linux, but no worry.

2. Tried the `makefile2dot.py` fiel I got from [here](https://github.com/vak/makefile2dot). This works on my windows machine, which has Python after:

* I added `C:\\Python27` to the `PATH`
* put the `makefile2dot.py` in the top folder
* opened cmd.exe as admin
* ran `python makefile2dot.py <Makefile >out.dot` from the same folder. Note the `.py` added, as it didn't work before.

This produces a `.dot` file. 

BUT. 

* It doesn't expand the variables. So basically this means leaving all the file names explicit instead of using variables for lists of 
* I just used agread and plot in Rgraphviz, which works, nbut not sure how to add the arrows. 
* Also the .dot file has all the `$(FOLDER)/` strings in front of file names, which makes it perhaps a bit unwieldy. Need to see how to stript hem off

3. OK, so I'll try installing Graphviz on the machine, so I can use `dot` as the command directly. Alhtough it would be cool to have the R version as well. Hmm, need to make this work on both linux and ubuntu..

4. this is all i've got with package `Rgraphviz`
make <- agread(file = "out.dot")
make2 <- agopen(make)
make@edgemode <- "directed"

plot(make)
edgeData(make)

. Next task is figuring out whether i want render or knitr or ezknitr? And how to get rid of those annoyign folders that knitting to pdf seems to leave behind. Hmm, seems like this is a weird pandoc/Windows artefact.. With a lot of help from this nice writeup: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/40563480/801398]

## Friday 24.11.2017

1. New attempt at visualisation based on this [https://heidiseibold.github.io/r/2015/09/16/Visualizing-Makefiles/]. But doesn't look too reliable long term, so I give up.

2. Back to the previous solution and try to get the dot file to work , this time using `DiagrammeR` [http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html]. OK, DiagrammeR looks swish af, but the problem is the .dot file I've got is not smooth enough. Like e.g. it would need to have special node statements and edge statements. That way node names are defined as labels, because otherwise node names cannot have special characters in them (., $, -, etc). 

3. Actually no, it's OK, DiagrammeR works directly using `grViz("out.dot")`!!

4. So let's add this to the make file then!!

5. OK, so the problem now becomes that the output of grViz is not sth that can be easily saved to a image file. aparently anyway. See it isn't renderred as a plot, it's renderred in the Viewer pane in  Rstudio. So the standard save plot things don't work here.

6. Now I want to run this visualisation of the makefile diagram externally, not inside the jounral:

* so that it is modular, and I can use the diagram elsewhere
* so that the journal can be renderred in .html, .pdf, .doc -- as it seems the grViz ouput only plays nice with .html. Aha, the output is actually an `htmlwidget`, that is helpful to know. Here are instructions for saving [leaflet ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31336898/how-to-save-leaflet-in-r-map-as-png-or-jpg-file), but that's for maps. 

7. OK, getting closer. Now the V8 package, which used to work for export to SVG is no longer maintained or some such thing, so instead there is DiagrammeRsvg. Now I need to figure out what to do with the svg. 

8. Right, svg is an odd thing. Looks like this might help `convertGraph`. For it to work you need phantom.js from here: http://phantomjs.org/download.html. Hmm, this will be a problem for switching between platforms

9. SO far Ive got this 

```
require(DiagrammeR)
require(DiagrammeRsvg)
require(convertGraph)
svg <- export_svg(grViz("make.dot"))
install.phantom("C:/Program Files/phantomjs-2.1.1-windows/bin")
convertGraph("make.svg", "example.png", path = "C:/Program Files/phantomjs-2.1.1-windows/bin")

```
and gives me 

```
Warning message:
running command ''C:/Program Files/phantomjs-2.1.1-windows/bin' C:/R_Libs/convertGraph/lib/command.js make.svg example.png' had status 127
```

## Sunday 26.11.2017

1. OK, how about another way of converting svg, `rsvg` looks like it could be a [thing ](https://www.opencpu.org/posts/svg-release/), I'll try that instead. Yes, and it works!

2. Now have to add this to the makefile, and to do that, I need to understand how to reference the target and dependenices properly. Also, how long are scripts in Rscript before I write them to file? How many require packages e.g. would I still cram into a `Rscript` line?

3. Here it is: 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("/figures/make.png"))
```

`![](figures/make.png)`

4. OK, this works, but I do now have the problem of relative paths between this .Rmd file and fiures.. so need to fix that with a chunk option or ezknitr. OK, so one thing I'm not too clear on is the fact that `knitr::knit` only renders to html apparently, and not to pdf, that is done by `rmarkdown::render`. But people think the pdf and doc compiles are knitting because the rstudio button is the same. But so looks like ezknitr won't work with pdf, also doens't parse YAML headers, at least according to the [open issues](https://github.com/ropensci/ezknitr/issues/). 

5. Apparenlty `here` is a simple way of sloving all my problems according to [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here#readme  ). ALthough there seems [based on Yihui's attitude](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1411) to be very little chance of a satisfacotry solution. But I think it works as `knitr::include_graphcs(here::here())`. So this is sorted then. 

6. Cool, relative paths in chunks from the project folder can be done using `here::here()` although i'm not clear on what Yihui's problem is, but it seems to be a robust solution. 

7. OK, now I need to move the journals folder from the top level, that was silly anyway, and now i can also test how portable the setup is atm. 

8. Also, note that the make file and being able to visualise it means i don't need a super-structured directory structure..

9. Let's see if I can't move the makefile2dot.py out of the project folder as well. Cool that works. 

10. Clean up the dir structure a bit. ALso figure out how to refer to target (`$@`) and to target dir (`$(@D)`). Neat.

11. How to add the tree structure of the folder to e.g. this file. One option is thrhough the makefile. Another is through some sort of R-system command?

12. OK, this is not working, system throws me a 127 error, shell kind of works, but not with ASCi characters, and even if I get it to work, this is Windows, atm, so god knows what will happen on linux. I'll try direct from the makefile creating a .txt file, and reading it in. ?! OK, no idea how to do that. I mean it works using tree, but as soon as i add the -a option it stops. 


*. For the record: my argument for keeping a non-streamlined makefile is based on [this article on why you should never rewrite code that works](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) 


## Monday 27.11.2017

1. clear out those pesky pdf folders that show up when Rmd files get compiled to pdf sometimes.  

2. `rm -rf` -f option is force (no error) and -r is recursive. Although I don't know how to search for the folders recursively, but they should all be two down from docs, so `./docs/*/tex2pdf*` should list them all.  

3. ad 12. from yesterday, i'll just do it manually i guess.

4. OK, so template folder has also been set up and saved. Only issue there is that it only works if `here::here()` can figure out the project folder. Aah, but usitn `rprojroot` instead and specifying that the `makefile` needs to be in the root folder, that works. 

5. Before I call this finished, let me just move the make.dot file into processed data. 

6. OK, so clean template copy has been made. Now focus on VN. 

7. Appendix 2 is the directory tree from which I am migrating. 

8. OK, so now migration starts, how do I keep track of it though?!

9. First the mapping stuff. SO, looking at the `VietnamABM\Scripts\S01-maps.R` situation it looks like I had downloaded some shape file from an unknown locaiton, and then saved as .RData. But this needs to be tracable, so doing it again and proper. 

10. Now need to figure out how to deal with this. GADM seems to be a good source, even has a package `GADMTOols`, but I run into some library folder issues. Maybe I just download the file, but is that done in the makefile? or what. 

## Tuesday 28.11.2017

1. Hmm, does the `makefile2dot.py` know how to tell unpack e.g. `%` variables? No, it doens't work, I'll have to write them all out explicitly. I'll call that  feature not a bug :)

2. Ad 10 yesterday, OK so while `GADMTOols` looks great, there seems to be some sort of library issue, also I'm getting a projection issue, so I'll instead dowload the .rds file. 

3. So first need to set up the makefile to dowload the file if it doesn't exist. Jesus, this is a mess, I don't actually know how to do this on widnows (`curl` and `wget` aren't working) so maybe I should just download through R - if the file doesn't exist. 

4. OK, so Rscript to download it is good. 

5. Now i need a script to clean it and save the resulting rds for plotting. 

6. First problem is that the 63 provinces in the GADM map are not grouped by region. 

7. I finda  table of provinces and regions on Wikipedia. But there is an encoding problem.. Vietnamese characters.. But I need them Vietnamese in order to match the table with the datatable in the spatialpolygonsdataframe. 

8. Then I also need to fix the hyphen/dash situation to make the match. jesus. Then still have to manually match a few regions -- ToDo figure out how to do approximate matching in R..

9. OK, so now province and region table is added to the spatialpolygon dataframe. And need to fix the makefile.
